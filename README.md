# Personal Journal Manager

## Subtitle of the Project

A simple Python-based Personal Journal Manager that allows users to create, view, search, and delete journal entries. The application stores all journal entries in a local journal.txt file.

## About the Project

This project is a beginner-friendly Python program that provides an interactive menu to manage personal journal entries.

The program allows the user to select from the following options:

* Add a new journal entry.
* View all journal entries.
* Search for a journal entry using a keyword.
* Delete all journal entries.
* Exit the program.

The program stores journal entries in a text file named `journal.txt`. Each entry is saved together with the current date and time.

The program continues displaying the menu until the user chooses the Exit option.

## Features

* Displays an interactive menu.
* Creates a `journal.txt` file if it does not already exist.
* Adds new journal entries to the text file.
* Stores the date and time with each journal entry.
* Displays all saved journal entries.
* Checks whether the journal file contains any entries.
* Searches journal entries using a keyword.
* Performs case-insensitive searching.
* Deletes all journal entries after user confirmation.
* Allows the user to cancel the delete operation.
* Uses a class to organize the journal operations.
* Uses exception handling with `try` and `except`.
* Uses a `while` loop to keep the menu running.
* Allows the user to exit the program.
